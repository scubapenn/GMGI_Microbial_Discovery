# HMMsearch Pipeline Guide

This section outlines the steps to run `hmmsearch` in a project folder (e.g., `P10-A`) using the provided pipeline scripts.

## Pipeline Overview

### Step 1: Generate Configurations
First, generate the necessary configuration files for your project.

```bash
/work/gmgiMD/code/HMMsearch.Pipeline.dir/generate.configs.v2.sh P10-A
Step 2: Copy Required Files
Copy the required scripts and directories into the project folder (P10-A in this case).

bash
Copy code
cp /work/gmgiMD/code/HMMsearch.Pipeline.dir/run_* .
cp -r /work/gmgiMD/code/HMMsearch.Pipeline.dir/project_files/ .
Step 3: Run the Split Fasta Script
Execute the script that splits the FASTA files. Let this finish before proceeding to the next step.

bash
Copy code
./run_split_fasta.v2.sh P10-A
Step 4: Verify Split Fasta Files
Check if the split FASTA files were generated successfully.

bash
Copy code
ls searches/split_fasta/split_fasta_Nvir-*
You can also check the job status to ensure that the splitting process has finished.

bash
Copy code
squeue -u k.penn
ls searches/split_fasta/split_fasta_Nvir-*
Step 5: Run the HMMsearch
Once the FASTA files are split, run the hmmsearch with the following command:

bash
Copy code
./run_hmmscan.v3.sh P10-A
Step 6: Final Check
Verify that the search results are available:

bash
Copy code
ls searches/split_fasta/split_fasta_Nvir-*
Make sure that all steps are completed successfully before proceeding with further analyses.
